webAPP hacking
components of web application security::
presentation(browser)=>logic(webserver)=>data(database)

in presentaion(crosssite sciripting,exploite weakness etc)

qury string routings and http verbs::

Routing:
define actions

discovery of client security constructs


portection offered by browser::
phishing sites;
invalidated ssl certification
weak cryptography rules
mixed content
reflected cross site scripting
security headers

what the browser con't defend against::
params tempering(cookie,forms,headers,query string)
persisting cross site scripting

tools
net sparker for (spider)
burp suit(forced browsing)
(directory traversal)
banner grabbing with wget/curl
server finger printing(nmap,znmap)
acunetix(discovery or devlopment artifect)(check web scanner)
(dicovery of services via genrated documentation)
CVE.mitre.org(drupal)(discovery framework)
identifing vulnerable tragtes with shodan(shodanhq.com)(shodan tools)

tempering of untrusted data::
OWASP(open web application security project) TOP 10 RISKS:
AI INJECTION
A2 BROKEN AUTHENTICATION
CROSS SITE SCRIPTING
ETC...

Understanding Data::(something come outside of dir)
request body
request headers
query string
url routing
changing http verb
external service
 
Parmerter tempering ::
tools(fiddler)

hidden form field::

Mass assigment attack:
Model binding 

cookie poisoning:

Insecure direct object refrence:

defending against tempering
assue malicious intent
verify the server
clinet persistent is dangerous
whitlist allowable behaviors



Attack involving client

cross site scripting(XSS)
oauth
Dom 
persistent cross site scripting
content security browser header



encoding for right context
flag cookies as http only
identifing risks and evading filters

xssposd.com(website)
xssfilter evasion cheet sheet
owasp.org(website)
client only validation
insufficent transport layer security

PCI seurity standards

TLS 1.2 latest version of TLS instead of ssl strong cryptograhic algo

fiddler scripts
key logger(javascipt injection)

cros site request forgrey(csrf)	

Authcookie
anti forgery token



attack against identitiy mgt and access control
web application take more to calculate for hashing

Deniel of service attacks
n/w resources not avl
distrubuted denial of service(DDOS)
botnet

LOIC(low orbit ion canon)(tools)
DNS reflection attack (dns query )
amplicafication attack (request largewait )
NTP attack(spoof packet sending)
SNMP attack
SYN flood attack
RDP session


cloud flare model

improper error handling

insecure cryprographic storage:
salt sha1 has
