DDOS::
ddos in gaming services
GCHQ sercet (snowden leak)

slashdot effect

genrall check 7 and 4 for ddos


role of botnet in ddos
cnc server

http flood attack::volumatric attack
can staturate server resource
can statureate bandwidth
syn flood attack:

three way hand shake
syn->
syn +ack<-
ack->

in dos (ack in third step not transfer)

layer 4 attack usess udp and icmp protocol
udp ==>flooding random ports on target

source ip is spoof due to no handshek
icmp(internet control message protocol)
ping uses echo request echo replay

"smurf attack"(tools smurf)
icmp ping of death create buffer overflow


DNS amplification attack:

smiple n/w mgt protocol
n/w time protocol
ssdp(simple service discovery protocol)
all are runs of udp protocol
response is large as  compare request

peer to peer n/w

DC++(tools)(free p2p open source file shareing client)

slowloris (tools)attack:
low volume of request
send uncomplete get request:


permanent dos and phlashing:
replacing firmware:
bricking to device

Github man on the side attack:
greatFire.org
cn-nytimes
baidu analytics(chiness search engine)

defending against ddos::
looking into application and network stack (level 4 and 7)

defensive consideration:

discover dos attack pattern:
attack type
udp,tcp,icmp smurf attack(4)
http (7)

are they any uniques:
headers
target resoures:

establish intent

absorbing attack
capcity>attack
auto scale

establish traffic reputation
cloudflare(tools)


network level defence::

corero hardware device(tools)
disable unused port
block unnecessary protocol(like icmp)
filter ingress traffic
	repution block based 
implement blackholing and trapitting

AnyCast(n/w address and routing methodology)

cloud flare mitigation for ddos

Application layer defences:

web application firewall can inspect http traffic


load balancing


Cloud flare model::
