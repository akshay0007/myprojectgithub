gaining access password access:::

revellin a password from locally strored data or via transmission

CAC cards

brute force attack
syllable attack
hybrid attack
rule based attack

types of attacks::
passive online::
sniffing
man in middle
side jecking
firesheep(tools)

Active online::
hash injection
trojen/keylogger
guessing

offline attack::
rainbow
distributed n/w
pre computed hashes

non electronic::
dumster diving

social engineering

The Hash::
LM Hash/NTLM stores password up to 14 character

more cracking 3::

NTLM authentication
Kerberos authentication
salting
rainbow table and other options


NTLM authentication LM hash::(defautl auth) usages::
there is no kerberos trust between two diff forests
auth. is attempted by IP
if ur firewall blocking kerberos
password are not transimitted

Kerberos auth::
ticket based
fast
time based

domain controller(key distu center)
TGT(tikcet granting transmission)
