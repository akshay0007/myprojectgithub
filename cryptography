Main topic    ::::how to find
cryptography concept
encryption algo
encryption tools
public key infrastrure
email encryption
disk encryption
cryptography attacks
crptanalyiss tools

additonal cryptiographiy tools::
goverment access to key
DSA(digital signature) and related signature schmas
pretty good privacy
side channel attack

federal information processing standard(FIPS 186-4)
key genration in two phase
creating a public and private key

elleptical curve algorithm
electronic key genration every time when sending information
so another user cannt find

pretty good privacy::
often used for secure disk,mail etc

SIDE channel attack:::
attacks on algorithm how it implemented
attacks::
power consumption
mesuring variation in electomagnatic field
acoustic attacks exploit sound emiision such as from key board


Advanced study:::
what is ssh(secure shell)
hashing tools- get myfilehash
addition tools in the document
